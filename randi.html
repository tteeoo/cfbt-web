<h1 class="header">Free DART Pass for UT Dallas Students</h1>

<p class="my-4">

  If you are UT Dallas student and have a valid Comet Card, are registered and have paid the fees for the current semester, you can get a semester-long pass to use all of DART's public transportation for free.

</p>

<p class="my-4">

  To apply, visit the <a href="https://services.utdallas.edu/tools/gopass/">UTD page to request a DART GoPass</a> and fill out the form including your NetID and password (the same as to log in to eLearning).
  Then, download DART's GoPass app on the <a class="link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gopass/id673970506">App Store</a> or <a class="link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.unwire.projects.dart">Google Play</a>.
  Your pass should automatically appear in the app within a week. When asked for a ticket on a DART bus or train, simply open the app and your pass.

</p>
